----------------- IDEAS --------------------
Teleport from a letter to an unknown place, when one p teleports, the other matching letter dissappears

@ teleports players to the win square (19,11)/(19/12)

FIX
-------
The current gold scoring, create 2 different scores +100 for each $ and add to the final message.


Done:
1. 2 players both able to move
2. A player reaching a star wins, message displays, game ends
3. Teleporting
4.
5.



Multiple characters playing (O, X)
O start 1,1
X start 38,18
